# Two Rooms and a Boom AKA President Bomber!

An app to play the game President & Bomber AKA Two Rooms and a Boom. The game can have up to 30 players with several different roles each with a different objective however all of this still keeps the entire run time to less than 15 minutes for a game.

Two definitive teams - red and blue. The red team's aim is to kill the President by ensuring the Bomber is in the same room as the President at the end of the game. The blue team's aim is to do the opposite. Ensure the president is *not* in the same room as the Bomber at the end of the game. There are also "grey" roles that are not on a definitive team but affect the game in their own way with a separate objective.

## Facilitating the Game Experience

In today's climate of video conferencing and virtual play this element of role distribution can prove to be difficult. The app will handle this with ease by talking to a Firebase DB which would control the data that is written and read by users. The 'owner' of the game would input the roles he/she would like to play with and simply press a button to distribute a role to each player in the game's lobby.

The game comprises of 3 rounds, each shorter than the last.
